# Automate chores - set a pre-hook to verify commit descriptions

Git hooks allow you to automate tasks and enforce standards locally before changes are committed or pushed. In this challenge, you’ll create a Git hook to automatically verify that every commit message follows a specific format — helping maintain a clean and consistent project history.

Your task:

1. In your local repository, navigate to the `.git/hooks/` directory.
2. Create a new file named `commit-msg` to validate the commit message.
3. Implement a simple script that checks whether the first line of the commit message follows a rule of your choice — for example:
    - Must not be empty
    - Must start with a capital letter
    - Must be at least 10 characters long
4. Make the hook executable with `chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg`.

Test your hook by making several commits with valid and invalid messages to confirm that the hook blocks non-compliant ones.

Tip: This hook runs automatically every time you make a commit, so it’s a great way to enforce standards without manual review.
