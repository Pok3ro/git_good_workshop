# First blood - Create your first PR

Your mission is to make your very first contribution to this repository.

Start by forking the repository and creating a new branch with a meaningful name. In that branch, add a file in the `playground` directory with a list of your favorite somethings (quotes, movies, who do you think will win the F1 championship).

Once you're done, push your branch to the remote and open a Pull Request (PR) against the main branch.

This will help you practice the basic workflow of contributing to a shared repo.
